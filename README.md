# pentest-project
An automated network vulnerability scanner tool that helps to search for live hosts, ports, services and enumeration.

Designed the system for scanning live hosts within a LAN network to streamline information gathering and enumeration processes. Focused on identifying weak user credentials by using Bruteforce methods and auto-formulate a potential wordlist. This can be used for later post exploitation during penetration testing stage. The goal is to automate manual tasks of scanning the network for vulnerabilities, reducing latency, and facilitating analysis of exploitation and privilege escalation stages. Utilized tools such as Bash scripting, Nmap, Masscan, NSE enumeration scripts, Enum4Linux, Seclists, Hydra for this project.


a) Use of ANSI colour codes for better appearance and ease of reading information.

b) Nmap and masscan scanning techniques
